INTRO:
GENESIS is the annual robotic hands-on WORKSHOP 
conducted exclusively for the freshmen students enthusiastic to seek the adventure of inducing life 
to machines.
Genesis 17 gave an insignht on how to build an autonomous light guided retriever and carrier bot.
The workshop involved theory sessions on robotics and a practical session on bot-building.
The workshop requiring no prior experience in robotics was conducted for aspirants cutting across all 
departments.

Topics:
1) Mechanics - Gears, Servo Mechanism, Inverse Kinematics, Linkages and Four-Bar Mechanism.
2) Electronics - Micro controller peripherals (Timers and PWM, ADC, Interrupts, Serial Communication), Voltage Regulator, Motor Drivers and other components.
3) Programming - Embedded C.
4) Fabrication
